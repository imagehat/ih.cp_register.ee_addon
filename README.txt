CP Register Extended

When adding a new member via the control panel this extension
adds the option of sending a welcome email to the new member
containing their login information as well as the ability to 
optionally enter custom profile field data while registering 
them right from the new member register form.

The welcome email template is customizable in the extension 
settings - allowing you to add the following variables:

{screen_name}
{username   
{email}      
{password}   
{site_name}	 
{site_url}	 
{site_index} 
{site_name}
